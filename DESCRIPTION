Title: Practice Sets for Foundation Skills for Data Science
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David Hendry
Maintainer: David Hendry <dhendry@uw.edu>
Description: This package enables instructors to create practice sets for learning R. It is intended for learners who are just beginning. 
    Practice sets include coding prompts, answers, and, optionally, hints. Learners write R solutions to the coding prompts and receive feedback. In addition, this package provides functions for automatically grading student work.
    This package installs an Addin menu into RStudio, which learners use to select practice sets and have their work checked. Instructors are given a set of administrative functions for creating practice sets and for grading student work.
    Practice sets are specified with a small number of markup tags, which are used to wrap R code.
