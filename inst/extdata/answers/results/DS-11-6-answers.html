Checking your code:
   2/2 complete. Good work! &#128512;

   largest_arrival_delay <- flights %>%

<p style='text-align:center;'><b> Expected code:</b></p># Preset variables:
library("dplyr")
library(nycflights13)

# The code:
largest_arrival_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(faa = dest) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = "faa") %>%
  filter(avg_delay == max(avg_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
smallest_airline_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  filter(avg_delay == max(avg_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
