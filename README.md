This package enables instructors to efficiently create practice sets for
students who are learning to code in R. It is intended for learners who are just
beginning.

Practice sets include coding prompts, answers, and, optionally, hints. Learners
write solutions in R to the coding prompts and receive feedback. In addition,
this package provides functions, intended for instructors, for automatically
grading student work.

This package installs an Addin menu into RStudio, which learners use to select
practice sets and have their work checked. Instructors are given a set of
administrative functions for creating practice sets and for grading student
work.

Practice sets are specified with a small number of markup tags, which are used
to wrap R code.
