# pinfo201

_pinfo201_ enables instructors to create practice sets for learning to code in R. Practice set 
include coding prompts, answers, and, optionally, hints. Learners write R solutions to the 
coding prompts and receive feedback on their solutions. In addition, this package provides functions for automatically grading student work.

This package installs an Addin menu into RStudio, which learners use to select practice sets and have their work checked. Instructors are given a set of administrative functions for creating practice sets and for grading student work.

Practice sets are specified with a small number of markup tags, which are used to wrap R code.
